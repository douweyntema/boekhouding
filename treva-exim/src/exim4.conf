  # The following section of the ACL is concerned with local parts that contain
  # certain non-alphanumeric characters. Dots in unusual places are
  # handled by this ACL as well.
  #
  # Non-alphanumeric characters other than dots are rarely found in genuine
  # local parts, but are often tried by people looking to circumvent
  # relaying restrictions. Therefore, although they are valid in local
  # parts, these rules disallow certain non-alphanumeric characters, as
  # a precaution.
  #
  # Empty components (two dots in a row) are not valid in RFC 2822, but Exim
  # allows them because they have been encountered. (Consider local parts
  # constructed as "firstinitial.secondinitial.familyname" when applied to
  # a name without a second initial.) However, a local part starting
  # with a dot or containing /../ can cause trouble if it is used as part of a
  # file name (e.g. for a mailing list). This is also true for local parts that
  # contain slashes. A pipe symbol can also be troublesome if the local part is
  # incorporated unthinkingly into a shell command line.
  #
  # Two different rules are used. The first one has a quite strict
  # default, and is applied to messages that are addressed to one of the
  # local domains handled by this host.
  # If you have local accounts that include strange characters, you can
  # use the macro provided to change the ACL range or to disable the
  # check completely.
